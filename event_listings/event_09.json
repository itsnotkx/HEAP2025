Image adapted from: Brand Cellar In anticipation of Lady Gaga’s concert later this month, Lau Pa Sat has rolled out Gaga-themed bites, deals, and photo spots featuring her iconic set pieces. Hawker Mayhem is where Little Monsters will want to be at to grab pics with the singer’s famous 2.4m-tall “monster paw” sculpture and multi-hued psychedelic LED light installation at the entrance. On 24th May 2025, from 7.30pm-9.30pm, a live band will also be playing Gaga’s tunes. Plus, get a chance to snag merch like temporary tattoos, face gems, and LED glowing glasses to get into the zone.
