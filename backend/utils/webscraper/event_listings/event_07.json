    "Description": " 17th May-13th Jul  Image credit: Sofitel  Pop-up cafes from brands are slowly but surely becoming a thing, and here’s another – Sulwhasoo Café at Sofitel Singapore City Centre. As you’d expect, it’s all about inner beauty and Korean skincare vibes, so their menu is packed with yummy and good-for-you stuff like ginseng and collagen. The chefs at Sofitel whipped up the menu, mixing wellness with Korean food traditions. You can go for a set meal of either 2 courses ($45) or 3 courses ($65) , or just pick whatever looks good from the a la carte menu. Dishes include Creamy Kimchi with Tteok ($24) , Blackened Salmon with Cla Doenjang ($38) , and Peach Collagen Consomme ($19) . Plus, you can get free Sulwhasoo beauty goodies when you dine there. Spend at least $40 and you’ll get a 3-piece skincare kit worth $60. If you go for the 3-course meal, they’ll give you an anti-ageing kit worth $110. Address: 9 Wallich Street, Singapore 078885 Dates: 17th May-13th Jul Time: 11am-6pm Make a reservation at the Sulwhasoo Cafe . ",
